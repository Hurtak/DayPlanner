animations on displaying menu

finish current time indicator

allow manual rewriting of every time just like with start time

disable irrelevant buttons (delete button or move up button on first item) rather than hiding them

save menu state (opened on what item / closed)

save change of inputs (duration, item name, start time) maybe would be better on menuClose() rather than on .oninput

add input slider (or radio buttons) which will multiply items height (0.8x, 1x default, 1.2x) maybe detect this automatically and set it according to window height
